# Industrial-Automation-Logic
Project: Industrial IoT Sensor Bridge
This repository contains a prototype for an automated monitoring system.
▪︎Hardware Logic (.ino): Handles real-time distance sensing and threshold alerts.
▪︎Software Logic (.py): Establishes a Serial-to-CSV bridge for predictive maintenance logging.
   Designed for scalable integration between field devices and data analytics.
